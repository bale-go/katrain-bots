Move was #3 according to policy  (7.03%).
Top policy move was L15 (61.8%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are L15 (61.84%), N13 (13.44%), C3 (7.03%), D9 (3.69%), H14 (2.98%). Generated weights based on one minus gaussian with variance 56.25 around coordinates 11,12. Picked 146 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were C3 (7.03%), H14 (2.98%), J4 (2.59%), K4 (2.43%), K5 (0.36%) and picked top C3. ])
