AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are M1 (64.13%), A12 (12.09%), T15 (11.72%), H19 (5.23%), F7 (1.16%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 13,1. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were M1 (64.13%), K5 (0.08%), L5 (0.08%), M6 (0.07%), K6 (0.06%) and picked top M1. ];B[ah]C[Move 347: B A12
