AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are P9 (43.16%), O8 (20.70%), R6 (5.16%), T9 (5.10%), B1 (4.47%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 14,16. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were P14 (0.20%), O14 (0.10%), M14 (0.09%), P19 (0.09%), N14 (0.09%) and picked top P14. But found pass (0.95% to be higher rated than P14 (0.20%) so will play top policy move instead.];W[eo]C[Move 224: W E5
