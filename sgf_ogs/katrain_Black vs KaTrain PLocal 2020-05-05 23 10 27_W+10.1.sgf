AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are F6 (11.52%), L1 (7.75%), N6 (5.64%), M17 (5.53%), H11 (3.84%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 2,2. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were B4 (1.13%), B3 (0.81%), B2 (0.50%), C1 (0.22%), E8 (0.21%) and picked top B4. But found pass (1.24% to be higher rated than B4 (1.13%) so will play top policy move instead.];B[bp]SQ[][qh]MA[bp]C[Move 271: B B4
