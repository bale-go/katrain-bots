AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are T11 (39.29%), J8 (19.43%), H7 (18.90%), K19 (15.61%), M19 (3.46%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 9,12. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were G13 (0.06%), L16 (0.03%), J17 (0.03%), H16 (0.02%), F14 (0.02%) and picked top G13. But found pass (0.20% to be higher rated than G13 (0.06%) so will play top policy move instead.];W[la]SQ[il][hm][ba][ab][sl]MA[la]C[Move 258: W M19
