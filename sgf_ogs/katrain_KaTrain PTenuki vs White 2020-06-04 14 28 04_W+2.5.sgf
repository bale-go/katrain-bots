Move was #4 according to policy  (8.76%).
Top policy move was E12 (37.5%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are E12 (37.46%), B12 (15.04%), F6 (10.93%), J16 (8.76%), M13 (5.50%). Generated weights based on one minus gaussian with variance 56.25 around coordinates 6,4. Picked 107 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were J16 (8.76%), J17 (2.16%), K14 (2.01%), M12 (0.67%), L12 (0.50%) and picked top J16. ];W[hd]SQ[fp][bd][eo][gb]MA[ei]C[Move 106: W H16
