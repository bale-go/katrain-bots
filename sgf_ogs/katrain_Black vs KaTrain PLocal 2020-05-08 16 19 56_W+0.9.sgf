Estimated point loss: 7.2
Predicted top move was O3 (W+7.9).
PV: WO3 C4
Move was #142 according to policy  (0.00%).
Top policy move was O3 (64.5%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are O3 (64.54%), C4 (10.69%), D16 (6.18%), D17 (3.80%), M6 (3.22%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 17,3. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were T2 (0.00%), P1 (0.00%), R2 (0.00%), R1 (0.00%), S1 (0.00%) and picked top T2. ])
