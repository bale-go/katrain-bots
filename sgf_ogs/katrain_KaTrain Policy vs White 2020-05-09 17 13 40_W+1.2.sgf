Move was #1 according to policy  (82.68%).
Top policy move was E5 (82.7%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are E5 (44.42%), E4 (14.68%), F5 (12.18%), D5 (11.83%), E6 (9.88%). Switching to weighted strategy in the opening 4 moves. Playing policy-weighted random move E5 (44.4%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=2.00%, num moves > lb=5).])
