Move was #1 according to policy  (26.73%).
Top policy move was L4 (26.7%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are L4 (26.73%), M6 (21.20%), J9 (19.51%), S13 (17.42%), T4 (7.16%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 3,0. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were J1 (0.00%), E1 (0.00%), D6 (0.00%), D5 (0.00%), J2 (0.00%) and picked top J1. But found pass (0.01% to be higher rated than J1 (0.00%) so will play top policy move instead.];B[kq]SQ[kq][lo][ln]MA[ik]C[Move 271: B L3
