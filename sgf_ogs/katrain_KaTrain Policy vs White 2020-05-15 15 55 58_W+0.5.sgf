Predicted top move was Q16 (W+0.5).
PV: BQ16 Q4 D14
Move was #7 according to policy  (4.05%).
Top policy move was Q16 (25.6%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are Q16 (25.65%), Q4 (24.91%), D15 (10.38%), D14 (7.21%), R16 (4.70%). Switching to weighted strategy in the opening 18 moves. Playing policy-weighted random move Q17 (4.0%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=2.00%, num moves > lb=9).])
