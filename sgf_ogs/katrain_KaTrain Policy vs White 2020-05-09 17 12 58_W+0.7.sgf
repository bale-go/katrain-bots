AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are Q17 (9.14%), D3 (8.53%), C16 (8.48%), R4 (7.95%), D17 (7.84%). Switching to weighted strategy in the opening 18 moves. Playing policy-weighted random move D4 (6.0%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=2.00%, num moves > lb=12).])
