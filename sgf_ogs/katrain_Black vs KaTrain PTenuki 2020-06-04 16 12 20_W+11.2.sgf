Move was #4 according to policy  (8.29%).
Top policy move was E2 (59.9%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are E2 (59.93%), D4 (17.09%), E4 (9.61%), D8 (8.29%), D3 (3.26%). Generated weights based on one minus gaussian with variance 56.25 around coordinates 4,2. Picked 25 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were D8 (8.29%), A8 (0.10%), E8 (0.06%), A5 (0.06%), E1 (0.02%) and picked top D8. ];B[ef]SQ[fh][ab]MA[eh]C[Move 31: B E4
