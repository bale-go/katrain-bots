AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are D16 (26.08%), Q16 (26.01%), D4 (23.80%), Q17 (3.36%), D17 (3.26%). Switching to weighted strategy in the opening 18 moves. Playing policy-weighted random move Q16 (26.0%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=2.00%, num moves > lb=9).])
