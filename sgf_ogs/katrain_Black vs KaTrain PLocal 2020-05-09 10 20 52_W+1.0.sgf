AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are E10 (21.54%), E11 (12.57%), G15 (11.38%), J16 (9.31%), F11 (8.78%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 0,6. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were E10 (21.54%), F11 (8.78%), F6 (0.01%), F9 (0.01%), E5 (0.01%) and picked top E10. ];B[an]SQ[qf][ph][sf][oo][mh]MA[ag]C[Move 267: B A6
