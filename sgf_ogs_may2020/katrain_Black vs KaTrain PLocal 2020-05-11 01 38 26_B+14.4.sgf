Move was #1 according to policy  (6.44%).
Top policy move was F5 (6.4%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are F5 (6.44%), M8 (5.34%), F8 (3.66%), G7 (3.43%), J6 (3.39%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 0,16. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were F14 (1.58%), A16 (0.67%), D12 (0.63%), E13 (0.35%), E14 (0.31%) and picked top F14.
