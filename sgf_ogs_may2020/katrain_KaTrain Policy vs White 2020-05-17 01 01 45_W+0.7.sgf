AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are D3 (9.14%), Q17 (8.53%), R4 (8.48%), C16 (7.95%), Q3 (7.84%). Switching to weighted strategy in the opening 18 moves. Playing policy-weighted random move C16 (8.0%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=2.00%, num moves > lb=12).])
