AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are D16 (26.54%), Q4 (24.40%), D4 (23.72%), D3 (4.05%), D17 (3.73%). Switching to weighted strategy in the opening 18 moves. Playing policy-weighted random move Q4 (24.4%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=2.00%, num moves > lb=9).])
