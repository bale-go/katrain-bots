Move was #2 according to policy  (17.59%).
Top policy move was Q2 (17.9%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are Q2 (17.94%), C5 (17.59%), C4 (16.07%), E6 (10.50%), S5 (6.86%). Playing policy-weighted random move C5 (17.6%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=0.10%, num moves > lb=44).];W[dq]SQ[dr][lq][dq]MA[fo]C[Move 74: W D3
