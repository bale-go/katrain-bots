Move was #4 according to policy  (3.55%).
Top policy move was B4 (52.6%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are B4 (52.60%), K6 (5.43%), G9 (5.08%), K5 (3.55%), H8 (3.40%). Playing policy-weighted random move K5 (3.6%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=0.20%, num moves > lb=32).];B[mb]SQ[fe]MA[an]C[Move 95: B N18
