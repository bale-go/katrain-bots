Predicted top move was G2 (B+1.0).
PV: BG2 H3
Move was #2 according to policy  (13.42%).
Top policy move was G2 (81.2%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are G2 (81.23%), F6 (13.42%), G5 (2.93%), H4 (1.47%), H5 (0.49%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 5,4. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were F6 (13.42%), G5 (2.93%), H4 (1.47%), H5 (0.49%), H6 (0.00%) and picked top F6. ];W[ge]MA[ge]C[Move 16: W G5
