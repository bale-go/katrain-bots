AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are O10 (92.70%), T6 (0.74%), P2 (0.48%), N7 (0.45%), T5 (0.42%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 16,4. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were T6 (0.74%), T5 (0.42%), N5 (0.27%), M6 (0.19%), R8 (0.14%) and picked top T6. ];B[so]SQ[mj]MA[mi]C[Move 229: B T5
