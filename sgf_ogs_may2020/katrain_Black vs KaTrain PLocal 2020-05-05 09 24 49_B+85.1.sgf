AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are A6 (30.52%), A7 (15.72%), A5 (11.94%), H6 (6.89%), H11 (6.02%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 16,16. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were Q19 (0.35%), O13 (0.27%), Q14 (0.20%), P12 (0.19%), P19 (0.19%) and picked top Q19. But found pass (3.34% to be higher rated than Q19 (0.35%) so will play top policy move instead.];B[aq]MA[aq]C[Move 271: B A3
