Move was #26 according to policy  (0.33%).
Top policy move was R9 (22.7%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are R9 (22.65%), Q9 (13.41%), R8 (8.89%), R6 (8.80%), R7 (6.88%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 2,11. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were E10 (0.33%), B10 (0.08%), D9 (0.04%), E11 (0.03%), D10 (0.03%) and picked top E10. ])
