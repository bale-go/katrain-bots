Move was #3 according to policy  (10.17%).
Top policy move was N18 (20.7%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are N18 (20.67%), J14 (19.94%), J15 (10.17%), L15 (10.06%), M18 (6.30%). Generated weights based on one minus gaussian with variance 56.25 around coordinates 14,13. Picked 126 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were J15 (10.17%), L15 (10.06%), H14 (5.96%), H13 (1.04%), G13 (0.71%) and picked top J15. ];W[if]MA[if]C[Move 60: W J14
