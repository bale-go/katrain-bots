Move was #8 according to policy  (0.21%).
Top policy move was O16 (73.8%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are O16 (73.79%), D16 (9.31%), P5 (4.75%), P4 (4.52%), D17 (1.68%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 3,3. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were D3 (0.21%), D5 (0.08%), C4 (0.06%), D2 (0.04%), C3 (0.04%) and picked top D3. ];B[cq]SQ[eq][md][rc][mb]MA[cq]C[Move 49: B C3
