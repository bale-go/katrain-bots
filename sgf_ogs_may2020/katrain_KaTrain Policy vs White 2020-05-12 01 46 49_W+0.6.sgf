Move was #2 according to policy  (8.40%).
Top policy move was R4 (8.7%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are C16 (9.14%), R4 (8.53%), D3 (8.48%), Q17 (7.95%), C4 (7.84%). Switching to weighted strategy in the opening 18 moves. Playing policy-weighted random move C16 (9.1%) because strategy is weighted (lower bound=2.00%, num moves > lb=12).])
