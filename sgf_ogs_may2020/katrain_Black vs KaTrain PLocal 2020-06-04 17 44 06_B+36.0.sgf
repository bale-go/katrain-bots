Move was #13 according to policy  (1.27%).
Top policy move was B12 (27.0%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are B12 (27.02%), O4 (12.89%), G3 (8.35%), B5 (4.69%), Q6 (4.50%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 4,3. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were F2 (1.27%), G6 (0.77%), F7 (0.17%), E2 (0.17%), G5 (0.16%) and picked top F2. ];B[er]SQ[bh][hr]MA[gq]C[Move 73: B E2
