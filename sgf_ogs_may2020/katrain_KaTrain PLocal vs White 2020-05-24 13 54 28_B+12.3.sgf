Move was #1 according to policy  (61.40%).
Top policy move was D15 (61.4%).

AI thought process: Using policy based strategy, base top 5 moves are D15 (61.40%), C15 (29.01%), B14 (5.81%), C14 (3.04%), D18 (0.13%). Generated weights based on gaussian with variance 2.25 around coordinates 3,13. Picked 15 random moves according to weights. Top 5 among these were D15 (61.40%), B14 (5.81%), C14 (3.04%), B15 (0.03%), F13 (0.01%) and picked top D15. ];W[ce]SQ[ce]MA[ee]C[Move 50: W C15
